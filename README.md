## SIGEAR (Sistema de Gestión de Archivos)

## Description
It is a web system for managing files of the Memory Commission (Comisión por la Memoria), an area dedicated to providing information to citizens interested in learning about human rights-related complaints. The platform facilitates the management of these documents, engablig information search. It also provides an OCR tool for TIFF documents, allowing searches to be conducted on them.

## Technologies
Slim Framework, Twig templates, and a PostgreSQL database were chosen to manage the entire web system for the Memory Commission. Slim Framework, being a micro-framework, provides a lightweight and efficient structure for building web aplications. Twig template is employed for its simplicity and flexibility in creating views and templates. PostgreSQL, a robust relational database system, is used for efficient data storage and retrieval.
